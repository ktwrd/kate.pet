It's like if [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) and [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/) had a child, but it also gives the dopamine rush of a constant [pub push](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pub%20push) in [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com/). It also has a pretty darn small install size of 22gb, and download size of ~10gb, especially with the quality of the assets, but it also only has one map so far.

Only complaints so far is the big frame drops when lots of stuff is happening at once, but that's kinda expected [with the system specs I have](https://valid.x86.fr/6lj1xd).

Apart from that specific issue, it's a pretty darn good game to play, and I can even play without being stomped by nerds!

I was going to write an elaborate blog post about how cool it is, but I can't really be bothered (because work 'n life 'n stuff). If you want more frequent ramblings then look at my [mastodon](https://dariox.club/@kate), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/SeedVEVO).
