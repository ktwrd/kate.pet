So I recently re-wrote [my personal blog](https://b.kate.pet) in PHP because I wanted to re-learn it to potentially use it more in the future.

I've just gotten sick of modern websites be so bloated with the unnecessary usage of JavaScript to load entire websites when they can just be Server-Side rendered with traditional web platforms like PHP or ASP.NET (which I have been using for the [Xenia Bot Dashboard](https://xb.kate.pet)).

In my future web-based projects I'm going to try my best to make static websites (plain HTML with minimal JavaScript, like [like this](https://ktwrd.github.io)) or SSR projects with minimal JavaScript (like my bot dashboard and this website).
