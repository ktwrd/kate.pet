Shared C# Library that I use in most of my projects. Full of helper functions and utility classes that I use to reduce duplicated code.

Currently has some helper classes for [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api), and [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) (in their own projects/libs)
