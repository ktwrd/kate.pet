Open Software Launcher, an Open-Source framework for
developing your own launcher for internal applications.

Created while I was working at [Minalyze](https://minalyze.com), in order to find
a solution to manage automatic updates, distributing betas,
quickly deploying and publishing new versions, and managing
licenses for their staff and external companies.

**Note:** Doesn't include launcher since that was made internally at Minalyze.
